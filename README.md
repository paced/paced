My main passions in technology are usability/accessibility design, interactivity,
and creative and enabling advancements in technology.

I'm also very interested in:

- 🎮 interactive art
- 🕵️ security
- 🌉 system architecture

Outside of tech and my day-to-day, I'm interested in:

- 📝 writing
- 🎵 writing music
- 🎸 playing music
